# Unit 3: Editable Nodes

## Getting started

The frontend can be found in `client/` and the backend can be found in `server/`.
They are separate projects and must be run separately (in different terminals).

The server requires environment variables to be set. See `server/.env.example` for
the required environment variables (copy this file to `.env` and fill in the values).

For each project, you can run the following commands:

* `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm run dev` to run the development server
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

* `npm run lint` to run the linter
* `npm run test` to run tests (backend only)
