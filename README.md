# Unit 3: Editable Nodes

## Getting started

The frontend can be found in `client/` and the backend can be found in `server/`.
They are separate projects and must be run separately (in different terminals).

The server requires environment variables to be set. See `server/.env.example` for
the required environment variables (copy this file to `.env` and fill in the values).

For each project, you can run the following commands:

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to run the development server
  Runs the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm run lint` to run the linter
- `npm run test` to run tests (backend only)

## Design Questions (15pts)

### Use case and justification for extensions (7 pts)

The use cases that I am trying to address revolve around students being able to take notes in their classes. For example, a good industry software that I can think about that also tries to solve the use cases that I am thinking about for my assignment is Notion. A student taking notes for their classes might want to do different things with different types of text. For instance, a user that wants to remember something important should be able to highlight a piece of text. Or if a user wants to delete something but keep it in their notes as a constant reminder, they might want to strike some piece of text. If a user wants to make their notes concise, they can use a bullet list. All of these features and the examples mentioned above show why my features are suitable for this particular use case.

### Justification for save method (3 pts)

I decided to send changes to the database every time the user clicks on the save button. A Save button provides explicit control to the user, ensuring that they can update the database only when they intend to do so, rather than sending frequent updates automatically. Secondly, this approach minimizes the frequency of database calls, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the text editor. Lastly, a Save button can serve as a clear indication to the user that their changes have been successfully saved, thereby enhancing the user experience and providing a sense of reassurance.

### Notable Design Choices

1. To store the modified width and height of an image, I added attributes to the INode interface called `modifiedWidth` and `modifiedHeight`. There are also fields I added called `initialWidth` and `initialHeight` which keep track of the image's initial dimensions which are generated by the `getMeta()` provided helper function.
2. The width and height for images are always integers. I made sure to not include any decimal numbers (doubles).
3. There is a bug that happens when you create multiple links under the same anchor and then you try to delete a singular link. This bug also happens in the demo so I did not fix it.
